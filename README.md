# Bikesharing
Tableau work for data bootcamp

## Overview
- The Goal of this exercise was to gather data from NYC Citibike database in order to help convince investors to invest in a bike-sharing program in Des Moines Iowa. I used Tableau to create a story which helped visualize some of the key metrics, as well as Pandas to update the datatype for one of the columns in the csv used.

## Results
- The results of this project, as well as how the visualizations were used can be seen by visiting this [CitiBike Challenge](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/thomas.leonard7267/viz/CitiBikeChallenge_16587158782920/CitibikeStory) link.

## Summary
- I think this would be a good investment if the bike sharing program was marketed as an alternative way to commute to work and geared towards males. The data clearly shows that the majority of riders were male and that of the subscribers, most of them used bikes right before or right after work. A couple other visualizations that could have been used to better visualize the data would have been to create a map of the most popular start and end stations as well as getting a breakdown of the age of riders.
